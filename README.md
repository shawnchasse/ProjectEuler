ProjectEuler
============

My solutions to problems posted on http://projecteuler.net - these are all 100% original code by me. I've taken great pain to solve these without any help besides algorithmic ideas regarding the mathematical side of the problem.

To compile each solution due to pacakage dependency simply type javac <full path to .java file> from the top level ProjectEuler directory. 

For example, in order to compile the PrimeFactorizer.java class in PrimeFactor_p3 type:
javac PrimeFactor_p3/PrimeFactorizer.java

And then to execute the code just type in the package qualified name:
java PrimeFactor_p3.PrimeFactorizer <command line options>
